## Description

Crwn Clothing is a mock Ecommerce site.  The user can sign-up/sign-in, browse clothing options, add items to a cart, and proceed to the checkout page. I built this application to further develop and strengthen my skills using React.  While building it, I learned a lot about code structure, as well as implementing state and context.  I have further plans to incorporate Redux, as well as Stripe for mock payment.
